"BODY_TEXT" = "Chaos reigns in the galaxy! After the fall of the First Order, the New Republic struggles to maintain peace among the divided star systems. New alliances are forged... and ancient enemies resurface. Meanwhile, in the unknown reaches of the galaxy, a mysterious signal has been detected. An ancient call, lost for generations, that could alter the balance of the Force forever. Hoping to find answers, the young Jedi master REY SKYWALKER leads a secret mission into the unknown, unaware that a forgotten shadow has awakened... and will not be easily contained.

Meanwhile, in the corridors of the New Republic Senate, distrust grows. The core worlds demand control, fearful that a new threat may emerge from the chaos. Some senators push for total militarization, while others seek diplomatic solutions, ignoring the signs coming from the fringes of space.

On a forgotten moon in the Drahgor system, an ancient cult has begun to gather in the shadows. Bearers of forbidden knowledge, their leaders claim to have heard the signal long before anyone else... and are preparing a ritual that could open doors that should never have been touched. Their followers speak of a 'Herald of Rebirth,' a figure shrouded in darkness.

Unaware of the magnitude of the danger, Rey faces disturbing visions. Echoes of the past and glimpses of an uncertain future cloud her connection to the Force. However, her determination does not waver. She knows that what lies in the unknown reaches is not just a threat... but a test that will define the destiny of the entire galaxy.";
